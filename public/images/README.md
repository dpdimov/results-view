# Background Images

## Custom Plot Background

To use your custom background image for the scatterplot heatmap:

1. Place your background image in this directory
2. Name it `plot-background.png` (or update the component to reference your filename)
3. Recommended format: PNG with transparency support
4. Recommended size: 800x800 pixels or larger for best quality

## Supported Formats
- PNG (recommended for transparency)
- JPG/JPEG
- SVG
- WebP

## Usage
The background image will be automatically loaded and displayed behind the scatterplot points with 30% opacity to ensure the data points remain visible.

If no background image is found, the chart will display with a default white background and grid lines.
